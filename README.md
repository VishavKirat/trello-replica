# trello-replica

Summery:
This is a Trello replica project. The main motivation behind building thsi project was to get familiar with webpack and babel.
If you want to know about the webpack and it's cli command do check out the webpack.config.js file where I have elaborated each line with comments.
This is the MVP and your any kind of help will be appriciated.

List to accomplish:
1. Drag and drop
2. Login (I'm working on it as I wanted to try JWT and helmet firstly on diffrent project but soon I will update it.)
3. Share with peers.
4. Email reminders. (My all time fav.)
5. Twillio APi calls

Technology Used:
This is a Javascript full stack project. I have used react, redux, webpack, babel, node.js, MongoDb and JWT for this project to build.
Stay Tuned.

How to Run :

1. Clone the repository and dowload it by git command : git clone <the url>
2. Then install npm : (To install it go to the file directory and run the cli command : npm install)
3. If you need ony webpack file you can cli command : webpack (if doesnot work you need to install webpack-cli globally.)
5. If you want only front-end work you can start it by writting cli-command as : npm run start
4. To run the whole project in single cli command run : npm run start-dev

Just double check the Ports on which the front-end and your backend will be working on.
